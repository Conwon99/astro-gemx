                    Kambo is secretion from a large tree frog named Phyllomedusa Bicolor that resides in the upper region of the Amazon rainforest. Many tribes have used Kambo for thousands of years. Kambo was used by the tribes to clear "panema" (bad luck), fertility, general health, hunting and immunity.

                  How Kambo Works
                </h3>
                <div class="space-y-6 text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                  <p>
                    Kambo is applied by burning "gates" under the first layer of skin. The medicine is applied to these gates to allow the medicine to be absorbed through the body. Kambo has the ability to, unlike many other natural and pharmaceutical substances, to cross the blood brain barrier and reach deep in to the body in otherwise hard to treat areas. Unlike pharmaceutical medicines that force their way in to the body, peptides are welcomed into the body to create a more natural and harmonious biological changes. The peptides in kambo clean out the cells within your body and release toxins that no longer serve us through the Lymphatic system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    During the treatment I will initially apply one test gate so I can observe the reaction before I decide how many points to ensure a successful treatment. You may feel hot flushes, heart racing, dizziness, tingling and sweating. (This is normal so don't be alarmed) you will most likely vomit and may need to go to the toilet. You may become tearful due to having an emotional release. The process lasts approx 20-45mins many people report to have instant results however the integration process could take a couple of weeks.

                  Kambo was first researched in a lab by Vittorio Erspamer in the University of Rome. Vittorio Erspamer was responsible for first discovering the neurotransmitter Serotonin. Erspamer concluded that Kambo contains a 'fantastic chemical cocktail with potential medical applications, unequalled by any other amphibian'.

                    Only drink 1-2 small glasses of water maximum before treatment.

                    I would also advise in settling an intention of what you would like to get from the treatment. This will help you to surrender and let go of what is no longer serving you. It's helpful to look inwards at our patterns, emotions and traumas looking at how they negatively affect our life.

                    Most medications and supplements are fine with Kambo and the medication can be skipped on the morning of Kambo, e.g. antidepressants can be skipped on the morning of treatment and taken afterwards.

                  <p>
                    Antibiotics are best to be taken alone without Kambo. Kambo can then be taken after the course of antibiotics has been finished.

                    Please refrain from alcohol or recreational drug use for at least a minimum of 48 hours prior to Kambo treatment.
